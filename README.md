# hevy-workout-tcx
This is a Chrome extension for converting a Hevy workout to a TCX file.  It takes the JSON data that is used to populate workouts on hevy.com, and converts it into a valid TCX file.  The resulting file can be imported into apps like Strava.

## Getting Started
Currently, this is only available via this repo.  Clone this repo and load it as an unpacked extension into Chrome.
